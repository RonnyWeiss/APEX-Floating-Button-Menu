This plugin is used to add a floating button menu to the page.

Using the Plug-in is very easy just import the it and add it as dynamic action to your apex page with e.g. "On Page Load" as Trigger. Then use as True-Action the Plug-in. The rest is set as example by default, so just start the appliaction and look into the Navigation Bar.
